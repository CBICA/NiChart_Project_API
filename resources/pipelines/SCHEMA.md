# Pipeline YAML Schema

A pipeline YAML declares an ordered sequence of tool steps that transform user data,
along with data prerequisites, user-overridable parameters, and result metadata used
by the results and visualization endpoints.

Pipeline files live in `resources/pipelines/` and are named `<pipeline_id>.yaml`.
The filename stem (`<pipeline_id>`) is the identifier used in API paths and in
`harmonized_variant` / `base_variant` cross-references.

## Full schema

```yaml
# ── Identity ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
pipeline_name: string     # Human-readable display name shown in the UI.
description: |            # Multi-line description. Rendered in the pipeline catalog.
  ...
docs_id: <docs_id>        # Optional. Key into resources/docs/<docs_id>/ for long-form
                          # documentation. Several pipelines may share one docs_id.
root_pipeline: <id>       # Optional. Groups variants of one conceptual pipeline under a
                          # shared key, so a client can present them as one entry with a
                          # harmonized/standard toggle rather than as separate cards.

# ── Input notes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Optional. Short user-facing warnings about input requirements that the
# readiness check cannot verify — e.g. that a pipeline needs raw T1s rather than
# skull-stripped or registered ones, which is indistinguishable on disk.
# A list of plain-text sentences, shown verbatim in the UI (no Markdown or HTML).
# Omit the key entirely when there is nothing to say; the API then returns [].
input_notes:
  - "Upload raw (unprocessed) T1 images — not skull-stripped, bias-corrected or registered T1s."

# ── Variant cross-references ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Link harmonized and base versions of the same conceptual pipeline.
# Set exactly one of these (not both) if a counterpart exists; omit otherwise.
harmonized_variant: <pipeline_id>   # ID of the harmonized version. Set on base pipelines.
base_variant: <pipeline_id>         # ID of the base version. Set on harmonized pipelines.

# ── Categories ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Free-form tags. Used by the UI for filtering and grouping.
# Include "harmonized" on every harmonized pipeline — the API reads this to set
# is_harmonized: true in the catalog response.
# Well-known values: image-processing, segmentation, feature-extraction,
#   inference, classification, spare, lesions, harmonized, highlighted, testing
categories:
  - tag1
  - tag2

# ── Prerequisites ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Conditions that must be met before the pipeline can run.
# Each entry is either a plain string keyword or a structured dict.
requires:
  # Simple keywords — checked against the project's uploaded data:
  - needs_T1               # Project must have at least one file in t1/
  - needs_T1w              # Alias for needs_T1
  - needs_FLAIR            # Project must have at least one file in fl/
  - needs_FL               # Alias for needs_FLAIR
  - needs_T2               # Project must have at least one file in t2/
  - needs_T1CE             # Project must have at least one file in t1ce/
  - needs_ADC              # Project must have at least one file in adc/
  - needs_PET              # Project must have at least one file in pet/
  # Imaging modalities are defined centrally in app/modalities.py — needs_<code>
  # works for every registered modality (see GET /catalog/modalities).
  - needs_idat             # Project must have paired {MRID}_Red.idat + {MRID}_Grn.idat in idat/
  - needs_demographics     # Project must have a participants/participants.csv

  # When two or more imaging modality keywords are listed (e.g. needs_T1 + needs_FLAIR),
  # the readiness check also verifies that at least one subject has *both* files —
  # i.e. the same MRID stem appears in every required modality directory.
  # The response includes a `complete_sets` field listing complete vs. incomplete subjects.

  # Column validation — checks that participants.csv has the named columns,
  # optionally with type and range constraints. Used to drive client-side CSV
  # validation UI and server-side readiness checks.
  - csv_has_columns:
      - name: MRID

      # Optional per-cohort minimums, e.g. "at least 30 subjects with DX == CN".
      # Each entry counts subjects that have imaging AND a participants.csv row
      # satisfying every condition under `where`; a subject missing either side
      # is not counted. Conditions combine with AND — use `in` for alternatives.
      # String comparisons are case-insensitive and whitespace-stripped; numeric
      # bounds are inclusive. An empty cell never matches.

      # `recommended` additionally defaults to this constraint's own `required`.
      # Evaluated per cohort by GET /projects/{id}/readiness/{pipeline_id}, and
      # declared (with defaults resolved) by GET /catalog/pipelines/{id}.
      # A condition naming a column participants.csv lacks is reported as
      # unevaluable, which is distinct from a genuine count of zero.

# ── User-overridable parameters ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# Parameters that the user can supply at submit time via the `params` request body.
# Omit the section (or use {}) if the pipeline has no user-facing parameters.
# Step-level `params` blocks in the steps section are separate and not overridable.
parameters:
  <param_name>:
    type: int | float | bool | str
    default: <value>
    description: string     # Shown in the UI.
    choices: [val1, val2]   # Optional. Restricts to an explicit set of values.
    min: <number>           # Optional. Inclusive lower bound (numeric types).
    max: <number>           # Optional. Inclusive upper bound (numeric types).

# ── Steps ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Ordered list. Steps execute sequentially; each step must complete successfully
# before the next begins.
steps:
  - id: step_id             # Unique within this pipeline. Used in cross-step references.
    tool: <tool_id>         # Basename of a file in resources/tools/ (without .yaml).

    # Optional display metadata for clients that list steps (for example a
    # "start from step" picker). Each falls back to the invoked tool's own `name`
    # / `description`, then to null — never to the raw step id, so a client can
    # choose its own fallback. Set these when the tool's name reads poorly in the
    # context of this particular pipeline.
    name: string            # Optional.
    description: string     # Optional.

    # Input slot assignments. Keys must match slot labels declared in the tool's
    # `inputs` section. Values are either:
    #   ${STUDY}/...           — absolute path within the project directory.
    #   ${<step_id>.outputs.<slot>} — the resolved output of an earlier step. This IS
    #                               supported (_resolve_path / _STEP_REF_RE in
    #                               job_service), but no bundled pipeline uses it:
    #                               explicit ${STUDY}/... paths are preferred because
    #                               they stay readable to clients and keep "start from
    #                               step" predictable, since every step's inputs are
    #                               then plain paths a user can place by hand.
    inputs:
      <slot_label>: ${STUDY}/path/to/input

    # Output slot assignments. Keys must match slot labels declared in the tool's
    # `outputs` section.
    outputs:
      <slot_label>: ${STUDY}/path/to/output

    # Fixed parameter values for this step. These are NOT user-overridable.
    # User-supplied params flow through automatically when the param name matches.
    params:
      <param_name>: <value>   # Optional. Omit or use {} if no overrides needed.

# ── Results metadata ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Describes the pipeline's outputs for the results and visualization endpoints.
# Omit the entire section if the pipeline has no structured results to display.

      AnotherColumn: "a.u."

    # Feature definitions — semantic interpretation of output columns, surfaced to
    # the results API, the UI, and the MCP server (so an invoking LLM can explain
    # opaque columns like `y_score` or `prediction`). Sparse: list only columns
    # that need explanation; keyed by exact CSV column name. Columns absent from
    # this map are simply undocumented. Segmentation/ROI pipelines that carry a
    # `label_map` (below) document their columns that way instead — a `features`
    # block is optional there.

    # Completeness is enforced by `scripts/check_feature_docs.py`. New pipelines
    # ship an empty `features: {}` placeholder; fill it in and remove any TODOs.
    #
    # Per-column fields:
    #   definition    REQUIRED — plain-language description (1–3 sentences).
    #   label         optional — human-readable display name.
    #   units         optional — e.g. 'mm³', 'years', 'logit', 'a.u.'.
    #   direction     optional — how to read magnitude ('higher = more X').
    #   interpretation optional — caveats/thresholds ('not a diagnosis', ...).
    #   keywords      recommended — literature search terms (list of strings).
    #   references    recommended — curated citations (see below). A starting
    #     point for the reader/LLM, not an exhaustive bibliography.

## Path variables

| Variable | Expands to |
|---|---|
| `${STUDY}` | Absolute path to the project directory for the current user and project |

Paths are resolved at job submission time. The `${STUDY}` prefix is mandatory for all
input and output paths — the pipeline executor substitutes it before calling the backend.

---

## Step execution and caching

Steps run sequentially. After each successful step the executor writes a
`_provenance.json` file in each output directory recording the tool ID, input paths,
params, and finish time.

A step is skipped (cache hit) when:
- Its cache key `MD5(tool_id | json(inputs) | json(params))` matches a prior run, AND
- All input paths have modification times earlier than the prior `finished_time`, AND
- All of its declared output paths still exist, AND
- None of its outputs has been replaced by a manual intermediate upload since
  `finished_time`.

Cache reuse can be disabled per-submission via `reuse_cached_steps: false` in the
submit request body.

### Manual intermediate uploads and the cache

A user who already holds part of a pipeline's results can supply a later step's
inputs by hand (`POST /projects/{id}/files/upload/intermediate`) and start the run
from that step. Such an upload is recorded in
`{study}/_working/manual_uploads.json`.

That record is the last condition above. A step whose output was written by hand
did not produce what is now on disk, so reusing its cached result would adopt the
uploaded files as that step's own output. Two mechanisms enforce this:

- the upload drops any cache entry whose recorded outputs overlap the slot, so a
  normal full run re-runs the producing step; and
- the cache verdict itself rejects any entry — including one written before cache
  records carried output paths — whose outputs a recorded upload has since replaced.

Each cache entry therefore records `tool_id` and its resolved inputs and outputs
alongside the key. Entries written before that was added still work; they simply
cannot be matched by path, which is why the second mechanism exists.

---

## Harmonized pipeline conventions

- The base pipeline sets `harmonized_variant: <id>` pointing to the harmonized version.
- The harmonized pipeline sets `base_variant: <id>` and includes `harmonized` in `categories`.
- **Output paths must differ** between base and harmonized variants. Use distinct
  directory names (e.g. `ml_biomarkers/` vs `ml_biomarkers_harmonized/`) so that running
  one does not make the other appear complete in the results UI.

---

## Disabling a pipeline

Add its `<pipeline_id>` (one per line) to `resources/pipelines/disabled.txt`.
Lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments.

## Template

Copy this block into a new `<pipeline_id>.yaml` file and fill in the values.
